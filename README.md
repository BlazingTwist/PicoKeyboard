The codebase should be fairly adaptable, but you'll have to map out your keyboard-matrix on your own.  
You can find the spreadsheet I used to create the KeyMapper [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UPQMnKelYr9f5ZtArrkLHAALaYuC5VrK4pNIPA3vo14/edit?usp=sharing)

Depends on
* [`adafruit_hid`](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)
* [`German Keyboard Layout`](https://github.com/Neradoc/Circuitpython_Keyboard_Layouts)
